# Rationale
Losing personal belongings or pets is quite often a stressful experience, which is moreover reinforced by the inefficient and decentralised lost & found systems that are available. Individuals rely on social media posts, physical lost & found centres or word of mouth, often with limited success, to recover their items or pets. The need for an intuitive centralised platform for lost and found services is growing more and more as digital solutions advance.

The inefficiencies of existing methods highlight the need for a structured digital solution that has a simplified process of reporting and retrieving lost items/pets. Existing solutions lack categorisation, multi-criteria filtering and intuitive interfaces, increasing the item recovery time and making it unreliable. The objective of this study is to bridge the gap by developing a website that contains effective categorisation, clear and in-depth search filters and a straightforward reporting system, developing a better user experience and increasing item recovery. This project was partly inspired by losing my drawing portfolio on a bus; retrieving it required calls and a trip to the depot. A centralised digital system would have been far more efficient than scattered platforms like Facebook or Gumtree.
